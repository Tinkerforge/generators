Tinkerforge Mathematica Bindings

The Mathematica bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and Bricklets

library. The source/ directory contains the source code of this .NET library
and the examples/ directory contains Mathematica examples for every Brick and
Bricklet. For more information about the Mathematica bindings go to:

Tinkerforge Shell Bindings
==========================

The Shell bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and Bricklets from
your shell scripts. The tinkerforge file is an all-in-one Python script that
acts as a shell command. The tinkerforge-bash-completion.sh file is a bash
completion script that provides bash completion for the tinkerforge script.
The examples/ directory contains shell examples for every Brick and Bricklet.

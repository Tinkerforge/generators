Tinkerforge Ruby Bindings
=========================

The Ruby bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and Bricklets from
your Ruby program. The tinkerforge.gem file is a Ruby GEM that can be installed
with the gem tool. The source/ directory contains the source code of this Ruby
GEM and the examples/ directory contains Ruby examples for every Brick and
Bricklet. For more information about the Ruby bindings go to:

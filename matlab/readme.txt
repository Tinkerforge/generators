Tinkerforge MATLAB/Octave Bindings
==================================

The MATLAB/Octave bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and
Bricklets from your MATLAB/Octave program. The matlab/Tinkerforge.jar file is
a precompiled Java library for MATLAB. The matlab/source/ directory contains
the source code of this Java library and the matlab/examples/ directory
contains MATLAB examples for every Brick and Bricklet. The same set of files
also exists for Octave because there are slight differences in the Java usage
between MATLAB and Octave. For more information about the MATLAB/Octave
bindings go to:

Tinkerforge C# Bindings

The C# bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and Bricklets from your
C# program. The Tinkerforge.dll is a precompiled C# library that can be used on
Windows, Linux (Mono) and Mac OS X (Mono). The source/ directory contains the
source code of this C# library and the examples/ directory contains C# examples
for every Brick and Bricklet. For more information about the C# bindings go to:

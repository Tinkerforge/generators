Tinkerforge MQTT Bindings
==========================

The MQTT bindings allow you to control Tinkerforge Bricks and Bricklets over a MQTT broker.

The bindings act as a proxy which translates between a MQTT broker and a BrickDaemon instance, all Bricks and Bricklets are supported.

Usage
=====

Run the bindings after starting a MQTT broker and a BrickDaemon, an ethernet extension or a WiFi extension. Command line parameters can be used to connect to brokers and BrickDaemon instances on other machines (see below).

Note: The following examples assume, that you have installed the mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub tools. Other methods of communicating with a MQTT broker can be used, for example the PAHO library.

To call a Bricklet function, publish a JSON encoded message under the corresponding 'request' topic:

[GLOBAL_PREFIX]/request/[DEVICE_TYPE]/[UID]/[FUNCTION]/[OPTIONAL_SUFFIX]

For example to set the color of a RGB LED button Bricklet with UID Enx to yellow using the mosquitto_pub tool:
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/request/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/set_color" -m '{"red":255, "green":127, "blue":0}'

Functions which return values do so under the corresponding 'response' topic. To query the current color of the same bricklet use:
    mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/response/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/get_color"
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/request/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/get_color" -m ''

Occured errors are published under the 'response' topic. If for example a parameter is missing:
    mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/response/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/set_color" #Note that we register on the set_color topic here
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/request/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/set_color" -m '{"red":255, "green":127, "blue":0}'
the message {"_ERROR": "The arguments ['green'] where missing for a call of set_color of device Enx of type rgb_led_button_bricklet."} is published.
Error messages are also printed to the binding's stdout. 

Callbacks
=========

Callbacks can be registered under the 'register' topic:
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/register/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/button_state_changed" -m 'true'
and will be published under the 'callback' topic:
    mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/callback/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/button_state_changed"
returns:
    {"state": 0}
    {"state": 1}
whenever the button is pressed and released.

To deregister a callback, pass 'false' as payload instead of 'true'.

Callback configuration functions work exactly like in other bindings, so if a callback has to be enabled you need to:
- subscribe to the 'callback' topic
- register to the callback using the 'register' topic
- enable the callback with the corresponding 'request' topic

Topic prefix
============

The bindings can be configured to use another global prefix for all topics using the '--global-topic-prefix' parameter. The prefix can be used to disambiguate between two or more binding instances connected to the same broker. The prefix can be as long as needed, for example tf/instance/1/foo/bar.

Topic suffixes
==============

The bindings support arbitrary suffixes per topic. For example you can tag all messages of devices located in one room with the suffix /room/1.
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/register/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Enx/button_state_changed/room/1" -m 'true'
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/register/rgb_led_button_bricklet/gBs/button_state_changed/room/2" -m 'true'
    mosquitto_pub -t "tinkerforge/register/rgb_led_button_bricklet/Dod/button_state_changed/room/1" -m 'true'
    
To receive all callbacks sent from devices in this room subscribe to:
     mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/callback/+/+/+/room/1"
This subscribtion whill receive callback events generated by 'Enx' and 'Dod' but not 'gBs'.
          
To receive all messages subscribe to:
    mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/callback/#"
    mosquitto_sub -t "tinkerforge/response/#"


Start up
========

The bindings will publish a message to "[GLOBAL_PREFIX]/callback/bindings/restart" with 'null' as payload. This message can be used as a signal that the bindings where restarted. You then need to re-register all required callbacks.
